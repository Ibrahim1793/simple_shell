## Learning curve for this REPO

* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
  - In the 1960s and 1970s Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson invented Unix, arguably the world's most important computer operating system.
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
  - The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, sh, written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs and distributed with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975.
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
  -  Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie developed B based on BCPL. The language was designed for machine-independent applications.
